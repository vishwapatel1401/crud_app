Decription of my crud application: I have created a folder called crud_app which will do all the crud(create,read,update,delete)operations using ruby on rails. First of all, there is a folder called task_controller.rb in my folder, which will show the code of how the crud operation will work and then it will also give error if any of one filed is missing. The operations will be based on a task list, a user have to first login/signin using credentials and then only they can see the tasks. After doing login, a user can create a new task, delete that task, read that task as well as they can update and upload images to the task list. There is another file called application.css which will show the css and design of the tasklist. Inside the view folder, there are many different file such as index,form,show,edit,etc, which will simple show you the logic of how the crud application will work out. Lastly, inside the db folder it has created a task table which will define two different fileds called name, and description. To simply run the code, write: rails server in cmd and then open your brower and write localhost:3000, and it will automatically shows you the working code. Also, I have implement the crud code using the tutorial and add two different features, first is user have to login first and then they can see the tasks which was not added before and next, user can upload an image while creating a new task. Moreover, if you want to check the tasks list then do the signup first and then use the same id and password to do the sign in, after that you are able to see the tasks list.
